# Turtlesim-Python-Files
For personal use learning ROS on Turtlesim. See individual .py files for more specific credit.

Code in the ros_for_beginners folder is from chapter_5/hello world folder of https://github.com/Apress/Robot-Operating-System-Abs-Begs. Code in the roswiki_tutorials folder is adapted and dowloaded from https://github.com/clebercoutof/turtlesim_cleaner. 

This is my first github repo that contains files other than my own, so please feel free to correct me on issues providing credit, etc.
